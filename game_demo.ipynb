    "Indeed, each character starts in the $\\ket{0}$ state meaning \"alive\", while the $\\ket{1}$ state means \"dead\". Some role-specific actions, such as described below, are able to change the quantum state of some players to bring them closer to death...\n",

If the outcome of the measurement for a player is the state $\\ket{1}$ then the player is dead. Else if the state measured is $\\ket{0}$, the player lives for another day.  "
