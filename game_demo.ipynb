    "# **The quantum werewolf**\n",
    "Our game is a quantum version of the role game: \"Werewolf\". The main idea is that each character's state is represented by a qubit state, and that each role can apply a gate on a quantum circuit. \n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, each character starts in the $\\ket{0}$ state meaning \"alive\", while the $\\ket{1}$ state means \"dead\". Some role-specific actions, such as described below, are able to change the quantum state of some players to bring them closer to death...\n",
    "\n",
    "In the morning, when the village wakes up, the quantum circuit created and updated during the night will be measured in the Z-basis. If the outcome of the measurement for a player is the state $\\ket{1}$ then the player is dead. Else if the state measured is $\\ket{0}$, the player lives for another day.  "

That get has the effect that the next measurement on the targeted player will kill him with a probability of 90%.
